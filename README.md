# CSS Content Property Quirks and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues related to the `content` property in CSS, specifically when used with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  The `content` property, while powerful, can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  The example showcases issues related to incorrect image paths, empty attributes, and unexpected attribute values.

**Problem:** Unexpected behavior with `content: url()` and `content: attr()` within CSS.  Potentially broken image display or rendering problems due to empty or unexpected attribute values.

**Solution:** Implementing robust error handling, default values, and checks for attribute values before assigning them to `content` and providing fallback for image display.
