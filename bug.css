The CSS property `content` can cause unexpected behavior when used with the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements if not carefully managed.  For example, using `content: url(some-image.png);` might not display the image properly if the image path is incorrect or the image itself is broken.  Additionally, using `content: attr(some-attribute);` might unexpectedly change how an element is rendered if the attribute it references is empty or otherwise unexpected.
